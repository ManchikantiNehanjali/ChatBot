look very nice outside today . <end>',\n '<start> you re right . i think it s going to rain later . <end>',\n '<start> in the middle of the summer , it shouldn t be raining . <end>',\n '<start> that wouldn t seem right . <end>',\n '<start> considering that it s over ninety degrees outside , that would be weird . <end>',\n '<start> exactly , it wouldn t be nice if it started raining . it s too hot . <end>',\n '<start> i know , you re absolutely right . <end>',\n '<start> i wish it would cool off one day . <end>',\n '<start> that s how i feel , i want winter to come soon . <end>',\n '<start> i
